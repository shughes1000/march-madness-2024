# March Madness 2024

Using previous college basketball games, I aimed to accurately pick the results of the 2024 Men's and Women's March Madness tournament. However, creating a successful March Madness bracket involves much more than simply selecting the team with the best chance of winning. Many competitors will enter their bracket into a tournament pool with the sole objective of finishing as a top entry against potentially thousands of competitors' bracket entries. Thus, one must accurately predict upsets in order to win their pool. With this in mind, I used the following process to generate March Madness brackets: 

1. Create a machine learning model that predicts results of potential March Madness matchups
2. Convert matchup probabilities to probabilities that a team advances to a certain round in the tournament
3. Simulate generated brackets against hypothetical public brackets to find the bracket with the highest chance of winning a tournament pool

Because the file sizes are too large, it is unfortunately not feasible to upload all data used in the project. However, I have uploaded all relevant code.
