# March Madness 2024

Using previous college basketball games, I aimed to accurately pick the results of the 2024 Men's and Women's March Madness tournament. However, creating a successful March Madness bracket involves much more than simply selecting the team with the best chance of winning. Many competitors will enter their bracket into a tournament pool with the sole objective of finishing as a top entry against potentially thousands of competitors' bracket entries. Thus, one must accurately predict upsets in order to win their pool. With this in mind, I used the following process to generate March Madness brackets: 

1. Create a machine learning model that accurately predicts results of potential March Madness matchups. 
2. Use the predicted probabilities of potential matchups to generate simulations of the March Madness tournament. 
3. Compare the simulations against hypothetical public brackets to find the brackets with the highest chance of winning a tournament pool. 

Because the file sizes are too large, it is unfortunately not feasible to upload all data used in the project. However, I have uploaded all relevant code.
